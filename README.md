## 🧩 About me
I’m Mohamed Faisal, a second-year Computers & AI student at Cairo University, driven by a growing interest in machine learning, deep learning, and how intelligent systems can understand and process human language.

I approach the field with a learner’s mindset—consistent practice, structured study, and a focus on building a strong foundation before moving into advanced applications.

My core technical stack is built on Python and C++, underpinned by a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving. I am currently deepening my expertise in modern AI frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow to master advanced concepts in deep learning and NLP.

I actively apply my theoretical knowledge in competitive environments, demonstrating proficiency in data preprocessing and model ensembling: I achieved Top 4% in the competitive House Prices challenge, and Top 26% in the Titanic survival prediction.

Beyond my competitive focus, I have also developed several practical software projects, such as an Android Qur’an recitation app (Java/XML), an image-filter application, and OOP-based audio player (JUCE/C++). These projects have instilled a strong command of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI development, and the discipline required for building and deploying full-stack applications.

At this stage of my journey, my goal is to build a solid, industry-ready skill set by combining academic knowledge with continuous hands-on practice.

I'm always open to learning, connecting, and exchanging knowledge
